# odin-form-project

In this project, I will be making a clone of an Odin sign-up form.
The left side will be a simple background, and a logo for Odin.
The right side of the screen will be:
    At the top, a type of welcome message. Under that will be the form,
including:
<ul>
    <li>First Name</li>
    <li>Last Name</li>
    <li>Email</li>
    <li>Phone Number</li>
    <li>Password</li>
    <li>Confirm Password</li>
</ul>

The Password and Confirm Password inputs will have a class on it to check
if the passwords match.

Under the form, will be a section that has a Create Account button, and
a paragraph under the button asking if you 'Already have an account? Log in'
4/28/23.

After finishing the visuals of the project, I realized that I need a bit more
practice with adding text with ':after', for checking if the passwords are
the same. So until I get a little bit more practice with all of that, I will
not be completing this project. I will however be coming back go finish it.
4/29/23.
